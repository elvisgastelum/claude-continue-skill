description: Continue the next Kaneo ticket, move it to in progress, then commit and open the merge request. With `parallel [n]`, work up to n independent tickets in separate worktrees and merge them one by one. Manual action only, run with /continue.

## Arguments

Arguments passed to this run: `$ARGUMENTS` (empty means no arguments). Read them before doing anything else:

| Invocation | Mode | Ticket limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/continue` | Single | 1 (the single-ticket flow below) |
| `/continue parallel` | Parallel | 4 |
| `/continue parallel <n>` | Parallel | `<n>` (a positive integer, e.g. `/continue parallel 10`) |

If `parallel` is followed by something that is not a positive integer, or the first argument is not `parallel`, stop and say the argument is invalid. With no arguments, run only the single-ticket flow and ignore the parallel mode section.

## Single-ticket flow

/implement Continue next kaneo ticket work, move it to in progress, then commit and create the mr

## Parallel mode

Goal: take up to N Kaneo tickets that can be worked at the same time, build each in its own worktree until it is ready to merge, then merge them one by one, bringing each next branch up to date with the latest default branch before it merges.

### 1. Pick tickets that can run in parallel

1. Load the `kaneo-work-tracking` skill.
2. List the open tickets of the current project (To Do / Backlog), in priority order.
3. Read each candidate's relations. Drop any ticket that is blocked by an unfinished ticket, or that depends on another candidate.
4. Drop tickets that would clearly change the same files or the same feature area as a ticket already picked; conflicts are allowed but should be rare.
5. Pick up to N tickets. If fewer qualify, take what qualifies and say why the rest were skipped. If only one qualifies, run the single-ticket flow.
6. Show the picked tickets (identifier, title) and the planned merge order before creating anything.

### 2. Create one worktree per ticket

For each picked ticket:

1. `git fetch origin` and use the up-to-date default branch as the base.
2. Branch name: `<IDENTIFIER>/<short-kebab-description>` (e.g. `FEX-2/some-feature-getting-done`).
3. Worktree path: `<repo-parent>/<repo-name>-worktrees/<IDENTIFIER>-<short-kebab-description>`. Never under `/tmp`.
4. `git worktree add -b <branch> <path> origin/<default-branch>`
5. Move the ticket to In Progress in Kaneo.

### 3. Build every ticket until it is ready to merge

Launch one subagent per worktree, all in the same message so they run concurrently. Each subagent:

- works only inside its own worktree path, and never touches another worktree or the main checkout;
- implements its ticket, with tests and docs alongside the change;
- runs the project's checks and leaves them passing;
- commits with the `commit` skill, pushes its branch, and opens the PR (body starts with the Kaneo ticket link, no AI attribution);
- comments the PR URL on its Kaneo ticket;
- reports back: ticket, branch, worktree path, PR URL, checks run and their results, or why it is blocked.

Wait for all of them. A ticket that comes back blocked or with failing checks is left out of the merge loop and listed in the final report.

### 4. Merge loop, one PR at a time

Merge the ready PRs in the planned order. For each PR:

1. `git fetch origin`.
2. In that ticket's worktree, merge the latest default branch into its branch: `git merge origin/<default-branch>`.
3. If there are conflicts, resolve them locally (load the `resolving-merge-conflicts` skill), keeping the intent of both sides.
4. Re-run the project's checks. Do not continue if they fail; fix them first.
5. Commit the merge if needed and push the branch.
6. Wait for the PR's CI checks to pass.
7. Merge the PR.
8. Move the Kaneo ticket to Done.
9. Go to the next PR. Its step 2 now picks up the PR that was just merged.

Stop the loop and report when a conflict cannot be resolved with confidence, checks keep failing after a fix attempt, or a PR cannot be merged (review required, branch protection). Leave the remaining PRs open and untouched.

### 5. Clean up and report

1. After a PR is merged, remove its worktree: `git worktree remove <path>`. Keep the worktree of any ticket that was not merged.
2. Update the main checkout: `git checkout <default-branch> && git pull`.
3. Report a table: ticket, PR URL, status (merged / open / blocked), and what is left for anything not merged.
